            <p>
                Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that
                operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to
                associate data (the object's properties) with one or more methods.
    
                Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally use an object with only a single
                method.
